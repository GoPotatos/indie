            <p>This will be the small story about the start of Indie Reveal. </p>

            <p>My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.

                You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

                Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

                I was part of something special. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?

                You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Life finds a way. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?</p>
